# What's R?

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both for statistics but also data science.

- Open source software under **GPL**.

- Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. 

- Not just for statistics, but also **general purpose** programming.

- Is **object oriented** (= R has objects) and **functional** (= You can write functions).

- Large and growing community of peers. 


---

## RStudio.

RStudio is the premier R graphical user interface (GUI) and integrated development environment (IDE) that makes R easier to use.

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("R_vs_RStudio_1.png") 
```

.footnote[Source: [Rochele Terman's Intro to CSS Book](https://plsc-31101.github.io/course/r-basics.html)]


---
## Understanding the R Studio

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio.png") 
```

---
##  How to Interact with R ?

`Open RStudio!`

---

### Command Line (bottom left panel).

You can interact with R directly using the Command Line. The symbol `>` indicates that R is ready to work! Copy and paste the command below to your command line, and click enter.

```{r}
2+2
```

--

When you see the symbol `+` it means your code was not completed. Then, you should press esc to move back to `>`. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Incomplete Code

incomplete<- "I am going to give you an incomplete
```

---

## Using Scripts.

Open a new script: `File` -> `New File` -> `R Script`

The script is just a plain text file. But you can send command from the script to your command line directly.

--
#### `command + enter` (Mac) ou `Ctrl + enter` (PC).  
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Rode estas operação em um script. 
# Hashtags permite você comentar seu código. 
2^2
2*2
2/2
```

---

### Why Should I go with scripts?

- More appropriate when working with long codes. 

- Show others all your steps. 

- Allow your future self to return to your code. 


---

## Other Important Tips.

#### Comments.

Use # signs to add comments within your code chunks. Help yourself in the future and make as much comments as you can in your code!

```{r}
# Hello all!
```


#### Errors

When the text is a legitimate error, it will be prefaced with “Error:”, and R will try to explain what went wrong.
```{r}
plot("hello")
```
---

## R Packages. 

--
.pull-left[

#### What the Packages are?

- A set of thematic functions that someone put together for you. 

- Sometimes packages also bring data

- In the end, just a folder saved downloaded to your computer. 

]

--

.pull-right[

There are a number of `packages` that are supplied with the R distribution. These are known as ``[base packages](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/00Index.html)". 

Other we need to install. 

- Packages should be installed only once. 

      `install.packages()`

- Should be loaded every R session. 

  `library()`


]

### Installing Packages Via Cran.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools", force=TRUE)
```


### Load a Package.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
```


### Install Packages Via Github

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("electorArg/polAr")
```



---

## Asking for Help in  R

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Specific to a function
?mean  # Help para a função mean.
help(mean)

# More General
??mean

```

.center[
```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("ajuda.png") 
```
]

---

## Asking for Help on Google.

- **Google**: name of the function + the error message you are getting. 

- Remove all the information about you and your local path

- Try to understand the solution. Copy and Paste will rarely solve your problems.

# Objects in R

---

# Objects: Definition?

In simple terms, an `object` is a bit of text that represents a specific value. 

Objects names can only contain letters, numbers, the underscore character, and (unlike Python) the period character.

Assigning values to new objects is how you create things in R. 

---

### `Everything that exists in R is an object.`


<br><br>


---

## Creating Objects

*(assignment operator)* `<-`

```{r}
# Numeric Objects
x <- 5
y <- 7

# Character Objects
nome <- "Tiago Ventura"

```

All R statements where you create objects, assignment statements, have the same form:

```{r eval=FALSE}
object_name <- value
```

---

## Can I use `=` to create objects?

--

Yes. But...

]
--

### Best Practice

Use "<-" to create objects. And use "=" inside of functions. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
x<-6 
mean(x=c(5, 7))
```

---
## Whats is an object name?

An object name is just a piece of text.

Object names must start with a letter, and can only contain letters, numbers, _ and .. 

You want your object names to be descriptive, so you’ll need a convention for multiple words. 

Best Practice: 

- **snake_case:** style of writing in which each space is replaced by an underscore (__) character, and the first letter of each word written in lowercase.

---

## Other important commands

#### Checking my environment.

```{r}
ls()
```

#### Remove Objects

```{r}
rm(y)
```

#### Visualizing Objects

```{r}
print(nome)
```

#### Changing Objects

```{r}
nome <- "Tiago Augusto Ventura"
```

---

## Objects Classes

Every object in R has a **class**. The class describes what the object is. 

Main classes are:

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
library(tidyverse)
tibble::tribble(~ Example, ~ Tipo, 
                c("a", "swc"), "Character", 
                c(2, 3, 15), "Numeric", 
                c(1L, 2L), "Interger", 
                c(FALSE, TRUE), "Logical") %>%
  kbl() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))


```

---

## Checking the Class of my Objects. 

`class()`

```{r}
class(3)

class(TRUE)

meu_numero_da_sorte= "13"

class(meu_numero_da_sorte)

class(meu_numero_da_sorte==13)

```

---

## Another Way to Go: is.class?

```{r}
is.numeric(2)
is.logical(TRUE)
is.character("2")
is.integer(1L)
```

---

## Coercing Objects.

R allows you to easily change the class of your objects using the functions: `as.class()`

```{r}
# Cria Objeto
num_1_5 <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

# Altera a classe
char_1_5 <- as.character(num_1_5)

# Checando
class(char_1_5)
class(num_1_5)

# Ou
as.numeric("25")

```

# Boolean Operators in R

---
# Boolean ("logical") Operators

To complement our discussion on objects in R, let's briefly see how boolean operators work. 

**Important Note**: These operators are logical. Always return TRUE or FALSE.
        
        
```{r eval=FALSE}

        x == y      # equals to
        x != y      # does not equal
        x >= y      # greater than or equal to
        x <= y      # less than or equal to
        x > y       # greater than
        x < y       # less than
        x==1 & y==5 # "and" conditional statements
        x==1 | y==5 # "or" conditional statements

```

Boolean operators will be important in the future for you on tasks of data manipulations, creating new variables, writing functions and loops. 

---

# Challenge 1. 

Let's practice a bit  What do the commands below return? Try to guess!

#### Question 1:


```{r eval=FALSE}

install.packages(tidyverse)

```

#### Question 2:

```{r eval=FALSE} 
false <- "FALSE"
false <- as.logical(false)
class(false)
```


#### Question 3

```{r eval=FALSE}

mean(x = sample(1:50, 5)) == mean(x) # TRUE ou FALSE

```

# Data Structure

---

##  Vector

```{r}

# Numeric Vector
X <- c(1, 2.3, 4, 5, 6.78, 6:10)
X

# Class
class(X)

# Length
length(X)


```

---

## Matrix

**Main Feature:** Rectangular and Same typekni.

```{r}

# Coerce to a matrix
x_matrix <- as.matrix(X)

# Build a Matrix.
m <- matrix(1:10, nrow=5, ncol=2)
m
# Acessing a values
m[1, 1] # [rows, columns]

```


---

## List

**Main Feature**: Flexible, huge drawer where you can put anything you want. 

```{r}

# coerce to a list

x_list<- as.list(X)

# or

lista_1 <- list(X, as.matrix(X), as.character(X))

# Visualize a lista.

str(lista_1)

# Acessing a value: double [[]]
lista_1[[1]]

```

---

# Data Frame. 

1. Classic Database. 

2. Rectangular. 

3. Works with columns with different classes.

4. Like a excel spreadsheet .

---


## Creating a Data Frame. 

```{r}

# Coercing
as.data.frame(X)

# Criando Manualmente

data <- data.frame(name=c("Tiago", "Tiago"), 
                   last_name=c("Ventura", "Ventura") ,
                   school=c("UMD", "FGV"), age=c(30,32))
data
```


---

## Pre-Built Data Frames

```{r}
mtcars # already loaded in your R environment

```

---
## Pre-Built Data Frames from Packages

```{r}


## Bancos de Dados Pré-Construídos. 

devtools::install_github("apreshill/bakeoff")
library(bakeoff) # Chamando o pacote

# O que tenho no meu ambiente?
ls()

# ativa o banco de dados
data("bakers")
ls()

# Examine o objeto.
class(bakers)
str(bakers)
```

---

## Acessing Information from your Data Frame


    `data[rows, columns]`



**Rows**: Only using Numeric Index.


**Columns**: Using both Numeric Index or Textual Keys.

---

**Using Numeric Index**

```{r}
bakers[,1] # primeira coluna
```

---

**Textual Key**

```{r}
bakers$hometown

# Ou

bakers[,"hometown"]

```

---

**Row with Numeric Index**

```{r}
bakers[1:5, ]
```


---
### Boolean Operators... back, back, back again. 


```{r}
# Bakers com mais de 60 anos
bakers[bakers$age>60,]

#Bakers de Londers
bakers[bakers$hometown=="London",]

```

---

### Useful Functions to Understand your Data Frames.


```{r eval=FALSE }

head(bakers) # First lines

tail(bakers) # last lines linhas

summary(bakers) # classes

dim(bakers) # dimensions

glimpse(bakers) # summary

```



---

## Exporting Data Frames.

An crucial task you will perform in R relates to  exporting your results, including a new database. T

There are several functions to do this, depending on the format of the output you want. Some examples:

- `write.table()` for txt
- `write.csv()` for csv
- `write.xlsx` for xlsx
- `save()` to export as a RData

---

# Exporting as a  csv.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# make a fake data set

dfake <- data.frame(normal=rnorm(100, 0, 1), 
                    uniform=runif(100, 0, 1), 
                    pois=rpois(100, 10))
# write.function(data, name_to_be_saved)
write.csv(dfake, "dfake.csv")
```

---

### But.. wait.. where is my data? Where R is looking at ?

`R` does not intuitively know where your data is. If the data is in a special folder called "super secret search", we have to tell `R` how to get there.

We do this in two ways:

1. Learn where your files are.

2. Define your **working directory** for this folder: all your outputs and inputs will be there.


---

## Paths

Every time `R` is started, it looks at the same place (called _global path_), unless it is asked to go elsewhere.

```{r}
# Where is my R looking at?
getwd()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}

# Where should R be looking instead?
setwd("/home/venturat/Downloads")
```
---
## R Projects

A super useful way to organize your files in R is through the use of R projects. 

We are not going to cover this feature here in the workshop. 

But, I strongly reccommend you to read about it [here]()

---

## Importing data 

```{r}
# Check Dir
getwd()

# See what we have here.
list.files()

# import
dados <- read.csv("dfake.csv")

head(dados)
```

---

## Descriptive Statistics

Now that we can get data into R, we want to explore and summarize what's going on. 

`summary()` allows for one to quickly summarize the distributions across a set of variables

```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```

---

There are a wealth of useful summary operators that are built into `R`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mean()
sd()
var()
range()
min()
max()
median()
quantile()
fivenum()
colMeans()
rowMeans()
table()
```

...to name a few!
