### Better opportunities in the academic and non-academic market for researchers who feel confortable working with large, new, and unstructured datasets.

## Social Sciences in the Digital Era: Positives

- Plenty of data for free and easy access.

- New data Allows you to ask new questions.

- And also to find new answers to old questions.

- Higher Computational Power: New methods, more powerful, faster, and more accessible computers.

---

## Social Sciences in the Digital Era: Challenges

- Bigm Digital Data requires more technical training. 

- Computer Scientists care more about performance. 

- Social Scientists care more about theoretically relevant questions.

- Build more interdisciplinary  is hard at the personal, and institutional level.

### Our main goal during these two weeks to [introduce students]() to the basics of working with big data in the field of Computational Social Sciences (CSS). We will focus on [digital data, text, and network models]().

```
]

.pull-right[

- The lectures will be in English (mi portunol no es muy bueno todavia)

- But if you have issues asking questions in English, try it in spanish. 

- I understand spanish well, particularly if you are patient, and go **despacito**.
